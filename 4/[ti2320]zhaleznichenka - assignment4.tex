The problem of determining whether two Turing machines provide the same outputs is equivalent to the problem of finding a Turing machine that takes two Turing machines as an input, \emph{accepts} if they do provide the same outputs for all $x$ and \emph{reject} otherwise. If the latter problem is decidable, the former problem is also decidable, and vice versa.

Let define the latter problem as follows. 

\begin{center} 
$S_{TM} = \{<M_1, M_2> |$ $M_1$, $M_2$ are TMs and $M_1(x) = M_2(x)$ for any $x$\}
\end{center}

\textbf{Theorem.} $S_{TM}$ is undecidable.\newline

\textbf{Proof idea.} We use proof by contradiction and reduce $S_{TM}$ from $EQ_{TM}$, where $EQ_{TM}$ is the problem of determining whether the languages of two TMs are the same, as defined in Sipser, theorem 5.4. If $S_{TM}$ is decidable, $EQ_{TM}$ is also decidable, which is a contradiction with theorem 5.4. 

$S_{TM}$ is a more general case of $EQ_{TM}$. If $M_1$ and $M_2$ are recognized as producing the same outputs by TM $S_{TM}$, this would mean that they operate the same language (as requested by $EQ_{TM}$), and, in addition, end up with the same state of their output tapes. \newline

\textbf{Proof.} We assume that $S_{TM}$ is decidable and let TM $P$ decide on it. We construct TM $R$ to decide $EQ_{TM}$ as follows.\newline

$R = $ "On input $<M_1, M_2>$ where $M_1$, $M_2$ are TMs:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run $P$ on input $<M_1, M_2>$.
\item If $P$ accepts, \emph{accept}; if $P$ rejects, \emph{reject}."
\end{enumerate}

We have constructed a TM $R$ that decides $EQ_{TM}$ which is a contradiction with theorem 5.4, as $EQ_{TM}$ is undecidable. Thus, $S_{TM}$ that we used to construct TM $R$ is also undecidable. $\square$
